### Instructions on How to Contribute
Step 1: Install Git/GitHub on your system.

Fork the repository: This step creates a copy of the original repository under your GitHub account.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/original-repo-username/original-repo.git
cd original-repo
```

Step 2: Create a new branch: It's recommended to create a new branch for your contribution. This helps keep your changes separate from the main branch.

```bash
git checkout -b my-branch
```

Step 3: Make and commit your changes: Write your code or make the necessary modifications to the files in the repository. Once you're done, commit your changes with a meaningful message describing the changes you made.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add my contribution"
```

Step 4: Sync with the original repository: Keep your forked repository in sync with the original repository to incorporate any recent changes made by other contributors.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-repo-username/original-repo.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

Step 5: Push your changes and create a pull request: Push your branch with the committed changes to your forked repository. Then, create a pull request to propose your changes to the original repository.

```bash
git push origin my-branch
```

After pushing your changes, you can visit the original repository's page on GitHub or the respective hosting platform. From there, you can create a pull request by following the prompts.

Note that these commands assume you're using HTTPS to clone and push to the repository. If you have set up SSH keys, you can use the SSH URL instead for cloning and pushing.
